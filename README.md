Demo briefly showcases an early version of the interaction and minimalistic UI which i personally like.\
Each element of which is accessible using hotkeys, not only via the mouse.

### Implemented Features:
- date range selection: from -> to
- find/filter by regex
- calculate time spent
- merge the same tasks
- brief statistics on the sample

The code was written quite a long time ago!
I am absolutely sure that it has issues.
Do not judge strictly!
